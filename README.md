# meetup

Objective
To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven
development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch
upcoming events.

Context
Serverless and PWAs have grown in popularity over the last few years, and they’re both
considered to be the future of web development. By combining these two concepts, your app
will not only work as a normal web application, but it will also reap the benefits of both
serverless architecture and PWAs:
    ● Serverless: No backend maintenance, easy to scale, always available, no cost for idle
    time.
    ● PWAs: Instant loading, offline support, push notifications, “add to home screen” prompt,
    responsive design, and cross-platform compatibility.
    
Key Features
    1. Filter events by city.
    2. Show/hide event details.
    3. Specify number of events.
    4. Use the app when offline.
    5. Add an app shortcut to the home screen.
    6. View a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city.
